Open Source Fuse Machines

2 machines are included here:

- A "visco" style fuse making machine
- A blackmatch making machine

VYSKO

Most of the files here are parts for a fuse weaving machine for making fuse with a powder core, wrapped in 2 layers of helical-wound thread.

If you search online you will find several handmade machines for making this kind of fuse.  They are typically 100% custom machines, and they are typically pretty big or even commercial-size.

This machine is designed for hobbyist use.  It is limited in the length of completed fuse that can be produced - there's only so much room for thread and finished fuse.  This machine is comparatively compact, is very adjustable, and can be made without specialized components.

In addition to several copies of several printed parts you will need:

- 4 1/4" threaded rod 24" long
- 1 5/16" threaded rod 24" long
- 2 2mm shaft 10 cm long
- 3 608 bearings ("skateboard bearings")
- 2 mm round polyurethane belt ~ 2 meters
- 2 1/4" 1 1/2" bolt
- 1 8" x 8" x 3/4" plywood baseplate
- 1000 yards cotton sewing thread
- Meal (pyrotechnic composition)
- ~ 130 1/4" nuts
- ~ 200 #12 flat washers
- ~ 20 5/16" nuts
- ~ 20 1/4" flat washers

NB: the bearings are printed parts

Not much documentation available at this time!  Good luck!



Blackmatch Machine

![Blackmatch Version 1](https://github.com/jesseparker/vysko/blob/master/img/bm.jpg?raw=true)

This machine is for making blackmatch which is a basic fuse used in pyrotechnics.  Blackmatch can be used as a fuse, and is also used to make quickmatch.

In addition to about 12 printed parts you will need:

- 4 1/4" 3" bolts + nuts
- Cotton crochet thread #10 size (or similar)
- Meal + 5% dextrin (pyrotechnic composition)
