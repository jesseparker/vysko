Parts for a fuse weaving machine, and other fuse-related tools

Canon fuse is a fairly reliable and durable fuse for fireworks.  It contains a central core of a composition like black powder wrapped and contained by spirals of cotton thread

If you search online you will find several handmade machines for making this kind of fuse.  They are typically 100% custom machines, and they are typically pretty big or even commercial-size.

This machine is designed for hobbyist use.  It is limited in the length of completed fuse that can be produced - there's only so much room for thread.  This machine is comparatively compact, is very adjustable, and can be made without specialized components.
